* Parse "*.sln" files correctly to find all dependencies

* Generalize projects into groups by MsBuild elements "Import", "ProjectsReference" and so on
  instead of only "proj", ".props", ".targets".
  Use regex mask to choose projects type to build dependencies, for example
  --dmask="*.props", --dmask="*.targets", --dmask="*.settings", etc
  instead of "XPROJ", "PROPS", "TARGETS"

* Find variables to resolve projects paths in the projects themselves and resolve the paths automatically without ini-config
 
* Add possibility to print dependencies (projects nodes) without subdirectories (without clusters)

* Pass not parsed command line options into graphviz to customize rendering
